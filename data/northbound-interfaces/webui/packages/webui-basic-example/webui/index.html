                <p>
                    This package provides a simple web UI to interact with Cisco NSO through the Northbound
                    JSON-RPC API.<br>
                    It fetches and displays the current user, the NSO version, the list of loaded packages,
                    and the list of devices.
                </p>
                <p>More information about the NSO JSON-RPC API is available in the NSO Development Guide.</p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, using the browser developer network tools to inspect network requests in
                    NSO's main web interface, 'webui-one', is an effective strategy for understanding
                    JSON-RPC API usage. By analyzing network requests, payloads, and responses, users can
                    gain critical insights into JSON-RPC API methods and parameters, enabling more
                    efficient and informed API utilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This implementation adheres to the Content Security Policy (CSP) as established
                    by NSO's default and recommended configuration. By restricting resource loading
                    to the same default origin ('self'), all types of resources, including scripts,
                    images, stylesheets, frames, etc, can only be loaded from the same origin as the page
                    itself. This approach protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) and style
                    injection attacks.<br>
                    With great power in GUI customization comes great security responsibility.
