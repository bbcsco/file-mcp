Generating and Subscribing to NSO Northbound NETCONF and RESTCONF Notifications
===============================================================================

RESTCONF and NETCONF clients can subscribe to notifications generated by NSO
and applications using the NSO data provider API.

This example showcases four different sources of notifications:

- Send notifications to RESTCONF and NETCONF subscribers using the NSO DP API
  on an event stream defined in `ncs.conf`.
- Enable and forward notifications from a device over the NSO built-in
  `device-notification` event stream to RESTCONF and NETCONF subscribers.
- Do datastore updates to trigger NSO built-in RFC 6470 base notifications to
  RESTCONF and NETCONF subscribers.
- Do datastore updates to trigger NSO to send YANG-Push notifications to
  NETCONF subscribers.

RESTCONF and NETCONF client Python demo scripts send, trigger, and receive
notifications from NSO. See the `demo_rc.py` and `demo_nc.py` scripts.

All RFC 5277 extended by RFC 8639 Notification streams have replay stores
defined in `ncs.conf` and use filters only to receive notifications of
interest where needed.

Running the Example
-------------------

To run the RESTCONF demo:

    make demo-rc

Run the NETCONF demo:

    make demo-nc

See the `demo_rc.py` and `demo_nc.py` scripts for details.

Cleanup
-------

Stop all daemons and clean all created files:

    make stop clean
