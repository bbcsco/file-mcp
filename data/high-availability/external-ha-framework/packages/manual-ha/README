This package implements actions to manually handle simple fail overs
between two (2) NCS HA nodes.
The YANG model defines actions to tell one node to be a primary
and the other to be a secondary.

ha must be enable in ncs.conf for the two nodes. See the example
examples.ncs/web-server-farm/ha how to use this package.

The package requires configuration of

- names of the two nodes
- IP addresses of the two nodes.
- The cluster ID

This would typically have to be part of XML initialization files
for the two nodes. For example


  <ha-config xmlns="http://tailf.com/ha">
    <nodes>
      <n1-name>primary</n1-name>
      <n1-address>192.168.128.1</n1-address>
      <n2-name>secondary</n2-name>
      <n2-address>192.168.128.2</n2-address>
    </nodes>
    <cluster-id>clid</cluster-id>
  </ha-config>


The nodes must have the name of the node as an environment variable
thus to start e.g node n1 (on host 192.168.128.1), it must be started
as

$ NCS_HA_NODE=primary ncs -c ncs.conf

The Java code that implements the actions, read this variable to
figure out weather it is node n1 or n2
